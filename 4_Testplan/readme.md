# I2C LCD With clock

- The lcd comes in very handy as a debug tool. You can write everything to the display that might be important for trouble shooting.

  Besides that, there are many more reasons to use an lcd in your projects. I think my next blog will be an ADC library for the analog 
  
  ports and I will write this on a display to understand the working of the analog pins.
